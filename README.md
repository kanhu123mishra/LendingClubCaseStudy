# LendingClubCaseStudy
This repository is created as a part of the Exloratory Data Analysis Module required for Lending Club Case Study.



## Goals of the Case Study :
Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

The objective of the case study would be to identify the risky loan applicants and hence reducing the credit loss and also will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
